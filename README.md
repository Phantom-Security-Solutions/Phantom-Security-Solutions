## Project Overview

Phantom Security Solutions has been engaged to conduct a comprehensive adversary emulation assessment of SimCorp's cloud systems. The primary objective is to identify vulnerabilities and evaluate risks, with the potential to secure a long-term partnership contingent on the depth and quality of our findings. This engagement is driven by concerns from SimCorp's CTO regarding the security of their cloud infrastructure, following a previous incident involving sensitive data exposure due to a misconfigured employee instance. Our goal is to uncover vulnerabilities, enhance threat detection capabilities, and fortify SimCorp's overall security posture

## Team Agreement
You can view our Team Agreement [here](https://github.com/Phantom-Security-Solutions/Phantom-Security-Solutions/blob/main/Photos/401%20Team%20agrement.pdf). This agreement outlines guidelines for communication, collaboration, decision-making processes, and conflict resolution within the team.

## Standard Operating Procedure
We follow a set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to maintain consistency and efficiency within the project:

## System Selection

You can view what system selections we decided to go with [here](https://github.com/Phantom-Security-Solutions/Phantom-Security-Solutions/blob/main/Photos/ops-201d12%20Team%20Phamtom%20System%20Selection.pdf) but we selected the technology stack for Phantom Security Solutions based on the following criteria:

- **Vulnerability Assessment**: The chosen tools must effectively identify and assess vulnerabilities in the target network and cloud systems. Using Nmap, Nessus, and Nikto.
- **Versatility**: The tools we used offer a wide range of functionalities, from enumeration and scanning to exploitation and post-exploitation activities.
- **Customization**: The ability to develop and integrate custom scripts or tools to address unique challenges and exploit scenarios specific to the target environment.
- **Reliability**: Tools must be reliable and well-supported, ensuring they perform as expected during the engagement.
- **Security**: Tools must support secure connections and data handling to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of our testing activities.


## Topologies/Cloud Architecture Design
Here are some visual representations of SimCorp architecture and topology:


## Project Management Tool
We use [Trello](https://trello.com/b/q15rh0UJ/code-401-final) to track our progress and tasks. In Trello, we organize tasks into boards, lists, and cards, representing different stages of development. Each card contains details such as task description, assignee, due date, and checklist items.

## Scripts
We have a collection of scripts used in the project for various purposes:

*This script scan with nmap using the flag -vuln to find vulnerabilities, then it parses the scan results to metaspploit, searching their data base with the information from teh scan and attept the exploits found. 
* [PenTesting script](https://github.com/Cody354/Pen-Testing-scripts/blob/main/NMAP_vuln_scan.py)
