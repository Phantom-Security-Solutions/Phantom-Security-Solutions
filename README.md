## Project Overview
Our fictional company, InterSlice, Inc., has been hired to design and protect Cromulent Innovation's cloud infrastructure (also fictitious). For Cromulent Innovations, as a small startup scaling to a larger company, cloud infrastructure provides the greatest elasticity for growth and remote talent acquisition. InterSlice's contract with Cromulent Innovations includes implementing robust cloud security measures, setting up log aggregation (SIEM) components as well as ensuring CIS compliance.  The contract also stipulates a demonstration of the performance of the system when under attack.

* [Attack Architecture Design](Files/PDF's_Files/AttackArchitectture.drawio.png)

## Project Management Tool
We use [Trello](https://trello.com/w/interslice2) to track our progress and tasks. In Trello, we organize tasks into boards, lists, and cards, representing different stages of development. Each card contains details such as task description, assignee, due date, and checklist items.

## Scripts
We have a collection of scripts used in the project for various purposes:
* [SSH Brute Force](/Files/Scripts/bruteforce.py) : This script is a collection of security-related tools, including network scanning, brute-force attack simulation, and file encryption for educational and testing purposes.
* [SSH Lambda Script](/Files/Scripts/SSHLambda.py) : This script is intended to notify subscribers of the SNS topic about SSH login attempts by sending an alert message with details of the event. Useful for monitoring and security purposes, allowing administrators to be aware of and respond to potential unauthorized access attempts.
